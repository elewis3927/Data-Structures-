# Data-Structures-
Programs that implement a variety of data structures that include Arrays, Linked Lists, Maps, Queues, Stacks, Graphs, and Trees.

Asg03: A program that implements and compares quick sort and a merge sort.

Asg05: A program and that represents a simple calculator using a behavioral design pattern.

Asg07: A program that uses a constructed tree of possible game moves to create an AI that plays the user in the game HexaPawn.

Asg10: A program that simulates termites and wood chips. Termite AI follows a certain "language" that decides what its next move will be. Program is meant to practice with threads and avoiding deadlock.

Asg11: A partner program that simulates google maps to find the shorted bath to a destination based off given coordinates and traffic. Generates a weighted graph data structure then implements Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path and shortest time.
